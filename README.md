# Intelligent Resource Allocator

An AI-based resource allocation system that uses multiple optimization algorithms (Heuristic, Genetic Algorithm, A* Search, and Score-based allocation) to efficiently allocate CPU and memory resources among competing processes. The system features an interactive Streamlit web interface for visualizing and comparing different allocation strategies.

## Features

- **Multiple AI Algorithms**: Implements Heuristic, Genetic Algorithm, A* Search, and Score-based allocation methods
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy configuration and visualization
- **Resource Management**: Handles CPU and memory allocation with process-specific requirements and freed resources
- **Performance Comparison**: Compare the effectiveness of different algorithms side-by-side

## Installation

```bash
pip install streamlit numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

```bash
streamlit run aiproject.py
```
